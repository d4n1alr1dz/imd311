<p>I never thought that this year will be so fast to the end. Yes, i am suprise because this year it has teached me billion of lessons, give me experience that makes me become more aware of myself. Not to be focus on that, I want to express to this page how grateful I am to be known with some of the people that Allah SWT has written. Not gonna lie, i miss the person that make me become the happiest person in the world and now had become strangers. I am so grateful for every single thing that happened in my life. Thanks to for those who stays. I hope next year will be a blissful year for every single human in this world.</p>
